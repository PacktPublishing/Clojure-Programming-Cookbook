#Clojure Programming Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Clojure Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/clojure-programming-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885037), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
:dependencies [
[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
[com.novemberain/langohr "3.3.0"]]
```

You need a bit of time, a computer, and a text editor. That's all this book requires. Of course, previous functional programming experience is a big plus, but having motivation and energy is pretty much all you need.
