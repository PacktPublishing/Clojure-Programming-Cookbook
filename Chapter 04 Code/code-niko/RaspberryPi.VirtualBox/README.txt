RaspberryPi Emulation
**********************

Due to bandwidth restrictions, this link can no longer house the
files for emulating the Raspberry Pi. But fear not, we are now
hosting the files on linuxformat.com. Open the .torrent file 
included in this zip in your favourite BitTorrent client to
download a virtual box image with everything installed and ready
to go. Once you have imported the RaspberryPi.ova file into
Virtual Box, start the machine and log in with the user name 
rpi and the password password, then follow the instructions in
the README file on the desktop.

Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience, and we hope
you enjoy trying out this exciting new piece of hardware.
